# 1. read the setup
play setup.scr

# 2. configure the receivers
#    You can change the VDIF mode/mtu etc., the net_port will be filled in from
#    what was defined in each stream's setup.

# 3. start all recorders and append a suffix to the recording so we can tell them apart
#    Takes the '{stream_id}' suffix from the recorder definition (see "setup.scr")
#    Note: The string '{0}' means "replace with the script's first argument"
#          (so "{1}" would be the 2nd argument etc., see vlbish usage/help)
