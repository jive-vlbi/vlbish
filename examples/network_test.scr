# Purpose: do a network test between two jive5ab's

# define sender + receiver 
alias sender   (192.168.254.200, runtime=network_test)
alias receiver (192.168.254.44, runtime=network_test)

# configure the network setup: network protocol &cet
# Play with MTU as long as the value <= total link MTU
sender, receiver/net_protocol=udp; net_port=46227; mode=none; mtu=4400;

# for UDP based protocols
# - pudp (plain-UDP)
# - udps (UDP-with-sequence number)
# this parameter determines the interpacket delay.
# See jive5ab manual for "ipd="
#sender/ipd=60

# the receiver will discard the data to /dev/null
receiver/net2file=open:/dev/null,w

# tell the sender to connect to the receiver and then to turn on the dataflow

sender/fill2net=on:-1

# Start background job to monitor and let it run for some time, displaying
# stats every 10 seconds
