# Purpose: do a network test between two jive5ab's

# define sender + receiver 
alias sender   (192.168.254.200, runtime=network_test)
alias receiver (192.168.254.44, runtime=network_test)

# configure the network setup: network protocol &cet
sender, receiver/net_protocol=udp; net_port=46227; mode=none;

# the receiver will discard the data to /dev/null
receiver/net2file=open:/dev/null,w

# tell the sender to connect to the receiver and then to turn on the dataflow
sender/fill2net=connect:192.168.254.44
sender/fill2net=on:-1

# Start background job to monitor and let it run for some time
repeat=10,sender,receiver/tstat?; evlbi?;

sleep 30

# stop the transfer
